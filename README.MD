# Fibonacci-Sequence
# Definition 📜
_In mathematics, the **Fibonacci numbers**, commonly denoted Fn form a sequence, called the **Fibonacci sequence**, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1_
That is _F0=0, F1=1_ and _Fn=Fn-1 + Fn-2_ for n>1.

The beginning of the sequence is thus:
```
(0), 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144,...
```
# Process 💻
### Compile 💾
_Run the **Fibonacci.rb** script, we must compile the code from an **integrated development environment** (IDE) for Ruby._
Or on command line with the following command:
```
ruby Fibonacci.rb
```
If you compiled it in the IDE, the result should appear in the output window.

### Result 🏆

If you enter 100, the last number the series will give you will be:
 **218922995834555169026**
